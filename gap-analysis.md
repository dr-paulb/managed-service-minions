## Remaining Gaps

### 1. Scale Limits — Documented, Needs Production Validation

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Max concurrent minions per orchestrator replica | Bounded by Goose delegate pool. Estimated 10-20 per replica. |
| Max sessions per minute | Bounded by intent classifier latency (~500ms). Estimated 30-50/min with 5 replicas. |
| Bottleneck | LLM API rate limits, not compute or storage. |
| Scaling strategy | Horizontal (more Container Apps replicas) with Service Bus session affinity. |

The throughput ceiling should be validated with load testing in staging. See `testing-strategy.md` §Performance Tests.

### 2. Recursive Orchestration — Explicit Non-Goal for v1

The orchestrator spawning an orchestrator delegate (e.g., "Fix all 50 open P1 bugs" → 50 sub-orchestrations) is a deliberate non-goal. It introduces complexity in correlation ID depth, session fan-out, and result aggregation that outweighs the benefit for v1. Large batch tasks are handled by the existing cron + parallel minion model.

### 3. Production Validation

All current numbers (cost estimates, throughput ceilings, RTO/RPO targets) are calculated or estimated. They must be validated in staging and production. The Grafana dashboards and alert rules are designed to surface discrepancies.
