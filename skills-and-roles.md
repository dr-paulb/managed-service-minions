### 4. Prompt/LLM Engineer

**What they do:**

## Team Size Scenarios

### Lean Team (3–4 people)

| Person | Roles Combined |
|---|---|
| Engineer 1 | Goose/Agent + MCP/Integration |
| Engineer 2 | Azure/Infrastructure + DevOps/CI/CD |
| Engineer 3 | Prompt/LLM + QA/Test |
| (Part-time) | Security review + Product Owner (shared with another team) |

**Feasible for:** Phases 1–2. Slower progress. No dedicated frontend engineer — dashboard deferred or simplified.

### Comfortable Team (5–7 people)

| Person | Roles |
|---|---|
| Engineer 1 | Goose/Agent (lead) |
| Engineer 2 | MCP/Integration |
| Engineer 3 | Azure/Infrastructure + DevOps/CI/CD |
| Engineer 4 | Prompt/LLM |
| Engineer 5 | Frontend/Dashboard (joins Phase 4) |
| Engineer 6 | QA/Test |
| (Part-time) | Security + Product Owner |

**Feasible for:** All phases on schedule. Full dashboard in Phase 4.

### Well-Resourced Team (8+ people)

As above, plus:
- Dedicated Security Engineer throughout
- Dedicated Product Owner
- Second Prompt/LLM Engineer (one per minion family)
- Second QA/Test Engineer (one for automation, one for manual/exploratory)

## Skill Gaps to Watch For

The hardest roles to fill:

| Role | Why hard |
|---|---|
| **Prompt/LLM Engineer** | New discipline. Few people have production prompt engineering experience, especially for multi-minion agent systems where prompts must interact correctly with tool calling. |
| **Goose/Agent Engineer** | Goose is new. Few people have built Goose extensions. But the concepts (agent loops, tool calling, delegates) are transferable from LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, etc. |
| **MCP/Integration Engineer** | MCP protocol knowledge is niche. But REST API experience is common. The MCP SDK handles protocol details — the engineer needs API integration skills more than MCP expertise. |

Mitigation: hire strong generalists. Goose extensions, MCP servers, and agent prompts are all learnable by a good engineer in 1–2 weeks.

**Phase 1** is infrastructure-heavy (Azure Engineer + MCP Engineer). **Phases 2–3** are agent-heavy (Goose Engineer + Prompt Engineer). **Phase 4** brings in the Frontend Engineer and ramps QA.
